#+TITLE: My dwm Configuration

* Overview
This repository contains my personal configuration of [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]] (Dynamic Window Manager).  
It's a minimal, keyboard-driven tiling window manager written in C and maintained by the [[https://suckless.org][suckless.org]] community.

My setup aims to keep dwm minimal while adding some essential usability patches and aesthetic improvements.

* Features
- Patched and configured dwm (Dynamic Window Manager)
- Keybindings optimized for productivity

* Applied Patches
List of patches currently applied:
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/anybar/][anybar]] to apply other statusbar
- [[https://github.com/rose-pine/dwm][rose-pine]] colorscheme for dwm
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fibonacci/][fibonacci]] for fibonacci type layout(Mod+r)
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/ewmhtags/][wemhtags]] to support xworksapaces

*(Modify this list based on your actual patches.)*

* Dependencies
To build and run this configuration, you’ll need:
- `dwm` (base source code)
- `rofi` (for application launching)
- `ghostty` or another terminal emulator
- `make`, `gcc`, and `git`
- `CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font` or any other nerd font but you have to change *fonts[] line 8:config.def.h
- Optional: `feh`, `xsetroot`, or `polybar` for wallpaper and status bar
