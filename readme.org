#+TITLE: My dwm Configuration

* Overview
This repository contains my personal configuration of [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]] (Dynamic Window Manager).
It's a minimal, keyboard-driven tiling window manager written in C and maintained by the [[https://suckless.org][suckless.org]] community.

My setup aims to keep dwm minimal while adding some essential usability patches and aesthetic improvements.

* Applied Patches
List of patches currently applied:
- [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/anybar/][anybar]] to apply other statusbar
- [[https://github.com/rose-pine/dwm][rose-pine]] colorscheme for dwm
